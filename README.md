# Circular-Times-Table-Visualization-Asm-
A z80 assembly example of my Circular Times Table Visualization

For school, I had to take an Advanced Topics computer class, which involved taking any online programming course we wanted. Well, I always wanted to learn z80 assembly for improving my calculator programming. I found https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/, and it was super easy to follow and use! I ended up coming with a resolution to re-create one of my old programs, but in assembly. So, this was my final attempt. I also made a writeup for it, which you can read here https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT9xaqVCft_oFnSXvaEWTwbFBDXMZHblGiuTR6FZ4hiyCYqFU6Ea0oJdxRd10c3CP9-VlyQpT3g2ct4/pub
